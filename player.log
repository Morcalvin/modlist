SOYUZ:[README] !!IMPORTANT!! There is a large chance this error is not related to RocketMan at all. RocketMan has patch on pawns that enables throttling, it will cause it to appear in the stacktrace and in visual exceptions, but in 99.9% of the time it's not RocketMan causing this issue but something down the line. RocketMan patches Pawn.Tick function just to add the throttling ability, the new code doesn't have any known issues and the issue is most likely futher down the line with error System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
